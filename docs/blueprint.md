Task Management App with RPG Theme and Blockchain Integration
This document provides a detailed and structured explanation of the flow and features of a task management mobile application for Android, designed with an RPG theme and integrated with blockchain technology. The app aims to help users manage tasks, hobbies, fitness, and finances while rewarding them with tokens for completing tasks and missions. The app uses a hierarchical Area/Project/Task structure for task management and focuses on skill development based on user activities.
1. Overview
The app combines task management with gamification and blockchain technology to make productivity engaging. Users manage their tasks, track skill progression, and earn tokens as rewards, which are recorded on a blockchain. The app covers four main areas: work, health, hobbies, and finance, with a focus on simplicity, personalization, and motivation.
Key Objectives

Provide a user-friendly task management system using an Area/Project/Task structure.
Incorporate RPG elements like skill upgrades, missions, and rewards.
Use blockchain to reward users with tokens for completing tasks and missions.
Suggest tasks to improve user skills based on their performance.
Ensure a seamless and engaging user experience with offline support and smart features.

2. App Flow
The app's flow is designed to guide users from onboarding to daily task management, skill tracking, and token earning. Below is the step-by-step flow:
2.1 Onboarding

Purpose: Introduce users to the app and collect initial preferences.
Flow:
User opens the app and sees a welcome screen with an RPG-themed animation (e.g., a virtual character welcoming them to a "productivity adventure").
User completes a short questionnaire to set preferences:
Areas of focus (e.g., work, health, hobbies, finance).
Goals (e.g., improve productivity, get healthier).
Familiarity with blockchain (to tailor blockchain-related instructions).


User sets up a profile with an avatar and optional RPG theme (e.g., fantasy, cyberpunk).
A brief tutorial (interactive, with a virtual mentor) explains the Area/Project/Task structure, skills, missions, and token rewards.
Optional: Connect to a blockchain wallet (e.g., built-in wallet or external like Metamask) for token management.


Features:
Customizable avatars and themes.
Simple blockchain wallet setup with beginner-friendly guidance.
Option to skip detailed setup and use default settings.



2.2 Main Dashboard

Purpose: Central hub for task management, skill tracking, and token overview.
Layout:
Top Section: User avatar, current skill levels (e.g., focus, health, creativity), and total tokens earned.
Middle Section: Daily missions (3–5 suggested tasks) with progress bars and rewards.
Bottom Section: Tabs for Areas (work, health, hobbies, finance), each showing active Projects and Tasks.
Quick Add Button: Floating button to add tasks quickly.


Features:
Visual progress bars for each Area and Project.
Notifications for upcoming tasks or mission deadlines.
Option to switch between list and Kanban-style views for tasks.



2.3 Task Management

Purpose: Allow users to create, organize, and complete tasks efficiently.
Flow:
User selects an Area (e.g., Health) from the dashboard.
Within the Area, user views or creates Projects (e.g., "Get Fit").
Within a Project, user adds Tasks (e.g., "30-minute walk").
User can mark tasks as complete, earning skill points and tokens.
App suggests new tasks based on user goals and skill gaps.


Features:
Area/Project/Task Structure:
Areas: Broad categories (work, health, hobbies, finance).
Projects: Specific goals within an Area (e.g., "Learn Python" in Work).
Tasks: Actionable steps (e.g., "Read 10 pages of Python book").


Drag-and-drop to move tasks between Projects or Areas.
Tagging system (e.g., "Urgent," "Daily," "High Priority") for filtering.
Quick-add feature for tasks (e.g., type "Walk 30 min" and app assigns it to Health).
Templates for common tasks (e.g., "Daily Fitness" template with tasks like "Drink 8 glasses of water").
Habit tracking for recurring tasks (e.g., "Meditate daily" with streak tracking).



2.4 Skill Development

Purpose: Track and improve user skills based on task completion.
Flow:
Each task is linked to one or more skills (e.g., "30-minute walk" improves "Health" and "Discipline").
Completing tasks adds points to relevant skills, displayed as a skill tree or radar chart.
App suggests tasks to strengthen weaker skills (e.g., if "Focus" is low, suggest "15-minute meditation").
Users unlock new missions or rewards as skills level up.


Features:
Skill categories: Focus, Health, Creativity, Time Management, Relationships.
Skill tree with unlockable abilities (e.g., "Advanced Focus" unlocks harder tasks).
Weekly skill reports with insights (e.g., "Your Health skill improved by 20%").
Visual radar chart showing skill distribution (see example in Section 5).



2.5 Missions and Rewards

Purpose: Motivate users with gamified missions and token rewards.
Flow:
App generates daily missions (e.g., "Complete 3 Health tasks" or "Plan your budget").
Completing missions earns tokens and skill points.
Tokens are recorded on the blockchain (e.g., via a smart contract).
Users can spend tokens in an in-app marketplace for virtual items (e.g., avatar gear) or premium features.


Features:
Daily missions tailored to user goals and skill gaps.
Random rewards (e.g., bonus tokens or items) for extra motivation.
Group challenges (e.g., "7-day fitness challenge" with friends).
Blockchain integration for secure token storage and transactions.



2.6 Financial Management

Purpose: Help users track and manage finances.
Flow:
User accesses the Finance Area to set budgets (e.g., monthly budget for food).
User logs expenses manually or syncs with bank apps (via secure APIs).
App suggests financial tasks (e.g., "Save 10% of income") with token rewards.


Features:
Budget tracking with visual charts (e.g., pie chart for expense categories).
Notifications for overspending or savings goals.
Token rewards for sticking to budgets.



2.7 Blockchain Integration

Purpose: Reward users with tokens securely and transparently.
Flow:
User connects a blockchain wallet during onboarding or later.
Completing tasks/missions triggers a smart contract to mint tokens.
Tokens are stored in the user’s wallet and can be spent or transferred.


Features:
Built-in wallet for beginners, with optional external wallet support (e.g., Metamask).
Low-cost blockchain (e.g., Polygon) to minimize transaction fees.
Off-chain token accumulation for small tasks, synced to blockchain weekly.
In-app marketplace for spending tokens (e.g., avatar customization, premium features).



2.8 Offline Support

Purpose: Ensure usability without internet access.
Flow:
User adds and completes tasks offline.
Data is stored locally and synced with the server/blockchain when online.
Token rewards are queued locally and minted on the blockchain upon reconnection.


Features:
Local SQLite database for offline task storage.
Automatic sync when internet is available.

  "type": "radar",
  "data": {
    "labels": ["Focus", "Health", "Creativity", "Time Management", "Relationships"],
    "datasets": [{
      "label": "Skill Levels",
      "data": [80, 60, 45, 70, 55],
      "backgroundColor": "rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)",
      "borderColor": "#36A2EB",
      "pointBackgroundColor": "#36A2EB",
      "pointBorderColor": "#fff",
      "borderWidth": 2
    }]
  },
  "options": {
    "scales": {
      "r": {

For financial tracking, use a pie chart:
{
  "type": "pie",
  "data": {
    "labels": ["Food", "Entertainment", "Savings", "Bills"],
    "datasets": [{
      "label": "Expenses",
      "data": [300, 150, 200, 350],

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 48, 94%, 56% (RGB Hex: #F0D932) to reflect the energy and dynamism of achieving quests and building skills.
- Background color: HSL 48, 20%, 95% (RGB Hex: #FAF7ED). This pale yellowish off-white provides a warm backdrop without overwhelming the interface.
- Accent color: HSL 18, 75%, 48% (RGB Hex: #D66220). Selected to provide contrast and visual pop to highlight actionable elements and progress milestones.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, creating a modern and readable interface.
- Icons: Custom-designed icons to represent areas, projects, tasks, and skills, providing intuitive navigation and enhancing the RPG theme.
- Subtle animations on task completion and skill upgrades.
- Layout should resemble the visual style of a game. A navigation bar at the bottom of the page is a must to enhance UX. Make it similar to most role-playing games, so users are accustomed to how the UX is.
