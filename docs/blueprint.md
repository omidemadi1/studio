- Icons: Custom-designed icons to represent areas, projects, tasks, and skills, providing intuitive navigation and enhancing the RPG theme.
- Subtle animations on task completion and skill upgrades.
- Layout should resemble the visual style of a game. A navigation bar at the bottom of the page is a must to enhance UX. Make it similar to most role-playing games, so users are accustomed to how the UX is.
